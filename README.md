# Association Rules
Association rules are a type of data mining technique that can discover interesting patterns and relationships among items in a dataset. They are often used for market basket analysis, which is the process of finding what products customers tend to buy together. 

For example, an association rule might be “if a customer buys bread and butter, they are likely to buy eggs as well”. 

Association rules can be measured by metrics such as support, confidence, and lift, which indicate how frequent and reliable the rules are. There are different algorithms for generating association rules, such as Apriori, Eclat, and FPGrowth.

## Implementation
- Importing the Libraries and Reading the dataset
- Pre-Processing the data
-  Applying the Apriori Algorithm
    - uisng different support and confidence values.
